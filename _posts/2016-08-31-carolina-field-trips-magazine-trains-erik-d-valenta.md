  Both my grandfathers worked for the railroads in Pennsylvania. You could say
  that they have a special place in my heart for that reason but there is
  nothing better than a train ride to calm the spirit. We are always in a rush,
  the medlodic clickity-clack of a vintage train ride helps bring things into
  perspective.
