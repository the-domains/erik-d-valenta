description: "PITTSBURGH -- Starting or off the bench. Healthy or on one foot. It doesn't matter. Ben Roethlisberger against the Cleveland Browns isn't a fair fight. The hobbled Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback passed for 379 yards and three touchdowns after coming in for injured starter Landry Jones as the Steelers overwhelmed the hapless Browns and Johnny Manziel 30-9 on Sunday."
